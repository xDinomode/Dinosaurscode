How to climb the page rank ladder.
-----
<br>

### 1. Title Tag
This is the first thing a user will see when searching Google. Make it short but descriptive.
<br>
<br>
![title tag](/images/title.png)
![title google](/images/titlegoogle.png)
<br>
<br>

### 2. Meta Tag
Use this tag to describe the content inside your page. One sentence is fine.
<br>
<br>
![meta tag](/images/meta.png)
![meta google](/images/metagoogle.png)
<br>
<br>

### 3. Neat URL
Avoid general names such as: **page1.html page2.html** and deeply nested urls: **/page1/page2/page3**
<br>
<br>
![url image](/images/urlgoogle.png)
<br>
<br>

### 4. 404 Page
Be sure to have a 404 page that is consistent with the rest of your website. It should link back to
your homepage and the server should be configured to throw a 404 status code.
<br>
<br>
<br>

### 5. Page Content
Make your content interesting to your users. Write short and easy to read sentences. Content should
be for the users not search engines!
