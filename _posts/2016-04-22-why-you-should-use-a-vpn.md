ISP's log every request you make and websites log your IP every time you connect to them.  

Turn on your VPN and suddenly you're invisible to the world. So now you're probably asking "how do I get a VPN?" Ok here's how.

# Install [CyberGhost](http://www.cyberghostvpn.com/)

They keep no logs and it's completely **free**!

The only downside of the free version is that you have to wait a minute or two before being able to connect. Also every 3 hours it kicks you off and you're forced to restart it.

# For mobile I use [TunnelBear](https://www.tunnelbear.com/)

Again they keep no logs but unfortunately the free plan only includes 500MB per month.

# Other viable options

If you're more tech savvy you could [set up your own VPN](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-openvpn-server-on-ubuntu-14-04)  

I personally have one set up for free on an [Amazon Ec2 VPC](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)

Amazon gives you it free for one year. Or you could use a [DigitalOcean VPS](https://www.digitalocean.com/) for $5 a month.
