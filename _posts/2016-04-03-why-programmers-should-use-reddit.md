[Reddit](https://reddit.com) defines itself as **"the front page of the internet."** And it's exactly that.

In case you've been living under a rock, Reddit is a website where users submit content found all over the internet. Other users get to upvote/downvote said posts.

Apart from the usual memes, this website is incredibly powerful for a programmer.

I personally find myself asking for help on [/r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming).

Simply write a post asking for help, once signed in. Make sure the title begins with the language you have trouble with surrounded with brackets: _[c++]I need help..._

Users usually reply within minutes with help. If not simply search for a different subreddit that is more specific to your programming language.

### So head on over there and sign up!
